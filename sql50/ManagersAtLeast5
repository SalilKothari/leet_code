# Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH Managers AS
(
    SELECT 
        managerId,
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerId
)

SELECT e.name
FROM Managers m
LEFT JOIN Employee e ON e.id = m.managerId
WHERE count > 4 AND e.id IS NOT NULL;


# Second solution

SELECT name
FROM Employee
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT managerId
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY managerId
    HAVING COUNT(*) >=5
);
